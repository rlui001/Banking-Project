## Pre-requisites
+ Please make sure all the requirements are fulfilled and mysql is set up properly. 
+ Run the luidb.sql file and ensure the tables and records have been created successfully before executing interface.py

## Requirements
+ sqlalchemy==1.4.22
+ mysql==8.0.22
+ python==3.9.7
+ pymysql==1.0.2

## Known Issues
* Because I have opted to use raw SQL queries, there is a potential risk of SQL injections. This may be addressed at some point when the project is complete.
